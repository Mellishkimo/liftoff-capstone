My capstone project is a web application titled Lightning Fast Horror Reviews

The application will allow users to read extremely brief and straightforward reviews for horror films, as well as 
the ability to submit reviews of their own.

The application will have search functionality, and perhaps most importantly, will allow users to sort all films
in the database by category rating, meaning they can seek out very specific film-viewing experiences for themselves.
